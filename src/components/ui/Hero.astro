    I develop intelligent systems at the intersection of machine learning and
    healthcare. My research explores how AI can learn from biological data to
    solve core problems. Through innovative approaches to representation
    learning, I aim to create models that understand concepts at their most
    essential level, bridging theoretical advances with real-world applications.
